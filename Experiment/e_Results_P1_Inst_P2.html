</div>

<p> In Part 2, you can work on this task for another {{C.round_time}} minutes and will receive {{C.piece_rate}} GBP per correctly solved screen.</p>

Part 2. The researches will match every donation made during the experiment. You will receive the confirmation that the donation was made via Prolific.
</p>

{{if treatment == 1}}
    <p> Before you start working on the task you can decide what share of your earnings from Part 2 should be donated. On the next screen, you can enter any number between 0% (donate nothing) and 100% (donate all).</p>
{{endif}}

{{if treatment == 2}}
    <p> Before you start working on the task you can decide how much you want to donate to charity. You can only donate from what you will earn in Part 2. On the next screen, you can enter a donation amount starting from 0 GBP (donate nothing). You can enter any number up to a pence. If the donation amount you chose, will exceed your actual earnings in Part 2, your complete earnings from Part 2 will be donated to the charity.</p>
{{endif}}

{{if treatment == 3}}
    <p> After you finished working on a task, you can choose what share of your earnings should be donated to the charity. You can only donate from what you will earn in Part 2. On the respective screen, you will be able to enter any number between 0% (donate nothing) and 100% (donate all). The share you choose will be automatically recalculated and displayed on the screen in GBP for you to make a decision.</p>
{{endif}}

<p> If after the donation is deducted, you earn more than {{C.GBP_threshold}} GBP in Part 2, you will receive a bonus of {{C.bonus_amount}} GBP. Therefore, ultimately, to receive the bonus, one needs to earn in Part 2 at least {{C.GBP_threshold}} GBP plus the chosen donation. </p>
