<p> The experiment consists of two parts. We will provide you with detailed instructions before each part.</p>

<p> <b>Instructions Part 1</b> </p>

<p> In Part I, you will see 9 numbers on the screen. Your task is to find among them 2 numbers that sum up to a "target" number. In each screen only two numbers sum up to the target number. You will advance to a next screen once you submitted a correct answer. You will have {{C.round_time}} minutes to work on this task and will receive {{C.piece_rate}} GBP per correctly solved screen. The timer will indicate how much time is left. Once {{C.round_time}} minutes are up, you will learn how many tasks you solved correctly and receive the instructions for the Part 2 of the study.</p>
<p> Note, most often it is faster not to use a calculator to find the solution.</p>
<p> Below you find an example screen. In this example, 82 is the target number and the pair of 48 and 34 is the solution.</p>
